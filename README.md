I thought of a game where player chooses the different color cube in a block of cubes in a limited time. It will start as a 10x10 block and will have smaller and more cubes while the game continues (maybe levels regarding the points player wins).  I can use random number method to place the cube and the color rgb number of it.

Actually it's not very creative as already there are this kind of games, but I want to try to make some individual touches to it.

I'll update this paragraph if I come up with a new idea!
